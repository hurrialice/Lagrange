> This is my first non-technical English post. Apologies in advance if my wording sucks.

I used to be a good student, but I never felt that I belong to that circle. In most of times, I would say that I just happened to get good grades, compared to my old friends who has been really hard-working for all the semester. Yes I did pay for this in Gaokao (Annual Chinese College Entrance Exam), which has been part of my PSTD. In short, PSTD is a trauma response triggered unintentionally - in my case, sudden uncontrolled crying and nightmare counts.



There have been two universities that I really like - Zhejiang University and USTC. In retrospect I admit that I have been day-dreaming - I would never be that good for either one of those. I remembered that Wenbo once talked to me about his (challenging but rewarding) life at USTC and I just could not help crying. Meanwhile I tried hard not to contact my old classmate who went to ZJU - what a difficulty to hold back tears!



My four years in XJTLU is like running before dawn - I do not know whom to compare with so I just keep running until I can see anyone at all. It is beneficial in a way that there is no stress that comes from ranking - I do not care that stupid number anymore - I am not getting it even if I cared that much in high school! (I did care about the scholarship though - money is REAL), but it also had made me very disobedient from the *norm*. I treasure my inner voice, and I try to make my judgment of things, which has often been a lonely choice. Luckily, as I mentioned in the beginning - since I have never  belonged to that "circle of elites" that speaks the same language, I am freed from any agreement but to be loyal to the truth in my eyes.



However, the eyes seeking for truth can be dangerous. I started to question the legitimacy of Beijing's suppression to HK protest (or the law itself) soon as I learned a new perspective outside of GFW - it is because the [dead girl](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/world/asia/hong-kong-murder-taiwan-extradition.html) or the [bookseller](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51624433)? It was a doomed war but they still insisted. This incident has largely changed my view - it should be an optimal fit for people with their government. The mainlander want steady growth of economy, want to feed their families - which is good enough to keep the status quo. But for the people who still want votes and freedom, they should be given the optimal fit governors, isn't it? 



Recently I saw [Vicky Xiuzhong Xu's Chaser lecture](https://www.vickyxu.com/comedy). She used to be a good student and even had a patriotic tattoo (red star) near ankle - but finally become "fixated in human rights" and have been a powerful voice for Uighur issues. "My life has been a joke" - she concludes. 

> To people on both sides, I ask you to find empathy in yourself and start seeing each other as human. The patriotic students are victims of an educational system and society where the No.1 criterion to be a good student and decent citizen is to love the country and party without any question.



I have been reading news that is inadequate for my age since very young - the dark side of things have been no stranger to me. My mother was very relieved telling me about [Tiananmen](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48445934) because she is never involved (thus her promotion has been as expected). I know about ["subordinate population"](https://qz.com/1138395/low-end-population-what-you-need-to-know-about-chinas-crackdown-on-migrant-workers/) that was asked to leave ASAP in winter in Beijing, I know the missing student (Miss Yue) who helped [workers from Jiashi ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasic_Incident) fighting for their rights, and many LGTB that are forced [electrified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yang_Yongxin) as a "cure" for their "disease". However I did not even bother to criticize / comment (how can we win over big brother?) Compared to her, I am more of a sinner - I did have access to those news, I did read, but have never thought about supporting them at all ("those people deserve it once they think about to fight back with the giant system"). I am not interested in Falungong, but I did cried over at [Letter to Masanjia](https://www.letterfrommasanjia.com/) - because we are human.



Today marks the second year since [Jinping Xi changed the constitution to enable himself in power for arbitrary length](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/25/world/asia/china-xi-jinping.html). For such an act that clearly contradicts with the sweep of history - only 6 out of around 3000 deputies did not votes for that. And yet my mother loves him. As he is right visiting in Wuhan, the epicenter of COVID19, and making  joke of himself (be led an established hospital that was faked to symbolize Chinese speed in construction, photoshop edited pictures showing two suns ...etc ), I would like to continue to care for my country, the world or anything that is bigger then myself and hold my minor voice. Long live freedom - the wall must fall.
