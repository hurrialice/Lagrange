Hi there I am Qing, "mostly harmless" second-year master student in computational biology and quantitative genetics in Harvard school of public health. 

My research interest in characterizing genetic variants. I am now developing an R package for germline risk prediction from family history in BayesMendel Lab at Dana-farber cancer institute, in the meantime I am doing my thesis benchmarking Mutect V1 and V2 at Gad Getz Lab at cancer genome analysis group at Broad institute.

This blog is run by myself and thanks to contributors to this jekyll theme. For now (07-31-2019) most of the blog posts are in Chinese, which I do not particular like about. I will try to add more articles in English as practice, and update more technical notes (By then I would consider switch to HUGO to work with blogdown since most of my tech ref would be in R).

I will be working as ACB in Gaddy's lab after graduation in May 2020. Feel free to connect with me if you happen to be around Boston!
