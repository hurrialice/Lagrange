title: Welcome to Qing's blog!
---

Qing is a master student at Harvard school of Public Health, with concentration on computational biology and Quantitative genetics. She graduated with a bachelor degree from Xi'an Jiaotong Liverpool University, majoring Biological sciences. She dreams to deploy computational tools to solve Biological questions on the bench, to gain a more thorough conceptual appreciation of life itself.

As I myself view, I am not a quick learner but I do learn concretely and steadily. One person's life is so limited that I do not expect to achieve anything marvelous. What I can do is to focus on concrete small steps, devoting my lifetime to make this world better place than when I came.

I have some (limited) experience with epigenetics, network biology and synthetic biology. Up until now bioinformatics and related biostatistics are what I am heading for. I do look forward to join any labs, i.g. this winter or so?

你好呀，张晴是哈佛公卫计算生物的在读master学生。我本科是在一所比较可爱的年轻的中外合作学校，西交利物浦大学，读生物科学（偏分子）。之前做过一点生物信息，合成生物的好玩的东西。虽然现在还没有lab想要我，我对未来仍然有不少的期待（大雾）

> 每天我都为一个新的自己而高兴，也许有一天我能再也不认识我自己——他说着我听不懂的语言，一种非人的语言，开始新的冒险。这也就是我所梦想的人生吧！

这里的文章多数是碎碎念，偶尔会有技术上的总结。让我们开始新的故事吧
